Pokémon Emerald Version 2
=========================

There's still (very) much to do, but when it's complete, it's a recode of Pokémon for Nintendo DS.
As the game itself is in German, I won't go into detail about the (planned) storyline (at least in the English description);
so far the game is set in the Hoenn region 2 years after [Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire) and [Emerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Emerald).

This game is intended to be played on real hardware, but [DeSmuME 0.9.10](http://desmume.org/) seems to be capable of simulating most of real hardware's features, too.

Features
--------

* A _fully_ working Pokémon engine, including
    * Displaying _and storing_ Pokémon
    * A fully working PokéDex, loading its data from the ROM's filesystem
    * A _fully_ working battle engine, capable of simulaitng single and double battles
    * Loading maps (for now only GBA-style maps are supported, 3D maps are planned)
      * _Events_
      * _Wild Pokémon encounter_
      * Animated map tiles
      * Player sprite, animated moving and surfing
    * Playing .mp3 as BGM, user customization of BGM via music stored on the micro SD card
    * RTC, _including overword changes based on time_
    * Saving the progress to the micro SD
    * Communicating with “the originals”
      * Playing with a save from a GBA version (saving is still not implemented yet, though)
      * _Link trading with Gen IV and Gen V games_
* Easy-to-understand and ready-to-(re)use code
    * Strict and intuitive naming conventions
    * _Good_ documentation

Features that still have to be implemented yet are _italic_.
